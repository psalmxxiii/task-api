# Task API

Simple containerized API that manages tasks, using Flask &amp; Celery

### In order to test it, just issue the following command in a Linux-based terminal, right from the repository's root folder:

```console
COUNTER=7 docker-compose up --build
```
*COUNTER is an optional argument to control the limit of a sample (dummy) counter function, representing a task.

### Then head to your favorite web browser, go to ```localhost:5000``` and use it!
